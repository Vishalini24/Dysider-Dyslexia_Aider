# Dysider-Dyslexia_Aider
Dyslexia is a specific language disorder of neurobiological origin. The condition causes reading, writing and speaking issues amongst growing children. It can be corrected with strategies geared to the innate strengths shared by dyslexic kids and individuals. Through this project we aim to give engaging support to dyslexic kids. With the help of appealing visual and textual aids, this application will help them improve their word recognition, vocabulary, spelling and decoding abilities.

With this project, we hope to shorten the learning curve for dyslexic children and assist them overcome problems they frequently encounter. Since, sometimes plain teaching methods can get boring, we have planned to bring in a fun twist to learning, by including engaging games and visual aids. Each module has features, that aim to address common problems faced by dyslexic kids, while kindling their creative potential. Each module is designed in an incremental fashion, such that each module is a level higher than the previous module. This makes it a smooth learning curve for the dyslexic kids.
